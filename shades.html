    Most people only know one London; but what if there were several? Kell is one of the last Travelers—magicians
    with a rare ability to travel between parallel Londons. There’s Grey London, dirty and crowded and without magic, 
    home to the mad king George III. There’s Red London, where life and magic are revered. 
    Then, White London, ruled by whoever has murdered their way to the throne. 
    But once upon a time, there was Black London...

        <p>
        Kell is one of the last Antari—magicians with a rare, coveted ability to travel between parallel Londons; Red, Grey, White,
        and, once upon a time, Black. </p> 
        <p>Kell was raised in Arnes—Red London—and officially serves the Maresh Empire as an ambassador,
        traveling between the frequent bloody regime changes in White London and the court of George III in the dullest of Londons,
        the one without any magic left to see.</p>
        <p>Unofficially, Kell is a smuggler, servicing people willing to pay for even the smallest
        glimpses of a world they'll never see. It's a defiant hobby with dangerous consequences, which Kell is now seeing firsthand.
        After an exchange goes awry, Kell escapes to Grey London and runs into Delilah Bard, a cut-purse with lofty aspirations.
        She first robs him, then saves him from a deadly enemy, and finally forces Kell to spirit her to another world for a proper
        adventure. Now perilous magic is afoot, and treachery lurks at every turn. To save all of the worlds, they'll first need
        to stay alive.</p>
